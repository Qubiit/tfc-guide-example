# Terraform Cloud Getting Started Guide Example

This is an example Terraform configuration intended for use with the Terraform Cloud Getting Started Guide hosted at https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-gettingstarted/tfc_overview

In this track, I created a DynamoDB table in AWS, a Terraform Cloud workspace, and GitHub repo that I used to provision, change, and destroy infrastructure.
